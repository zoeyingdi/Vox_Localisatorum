Our website is for our imaginary 4-person Language Service Provider called Vox Localisatorum.  It has 6 static pages: Home, About Us, Services, Blog (one page is for all the hypothetical blog entries and the other page is a sample blog entry), and Contact Us (which has a request for quote form).  We have localized the website into three languages: Chinese, Korean, and Russian.  We have incorporated effects in CSS such as a hovering effect on our cover image and there is some JavaScript in our request form.
